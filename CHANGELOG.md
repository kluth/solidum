- `CoverageAnalyzer` for estimating and analyzing test coverage
- Quality score calculation
- Issue detection and reporting

#### Agents

- `ImplementationAgent` - Autonomous agent for spec-to-code generation
  - 4-phase workflow: Analyzing → Implementing → Testing → Validating
  - Configurable analysis and validation options

#### Examples

- Atom implementation example (reactive state primitive)
  - Complete FSL specification
  - Event listening demonstration
  - Full workflow execution
  - Result extraction and display
- Basic agent example (Fibonacci function)
  - Minimal setup demonstration
  - Quick start template

#### Testing

- Comprehensive test suite with Vitest
- Unit tests for core functionality
- FSL validation tests
- Reflection loop tests
- Coverage analyzer tests
- > 80% code coverage

#### Documentation

- Comprehensive README with quick start guide
- API reference documentation
- Architecture overview
- Contributing guidelines
- Examples and usage patterns
- MIT License

#### Development Tools

- TypeScript 5.x with strict mode
- ESLint configuration
- Prettier formatting
- tsup for fast builds (ESM + CJS)
- Vitest for testing
- V8 coverage reporting

### Notes

This is the initial release of Solidum, providing a solid foundation for building
autonomous AI agents that generate code, tests, and documentation from structured
specifications.

Future releases will include:

- Support for additional LLM providers (OpenAI, Mistral, etc.)
- More specialized agent types
- Enhanced FSL features
- Performance optimizations
- Additional validators and quality checks
- More comprehensive examples
